    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h4>My Background</h4>
      <p>
        My name is Katy and I grew up right here in Seattle, Washington. It's a beautiful place that I am happy to call home again after living for four years in California. I have been working as an American Sign Language interpreter for the last several years, and while I will be sad to leave that community, I look forward to the opportunities ahead of me. I hope in the future to find a way to tie my knowledge of the Deaf community into my work as a developer. Some of my past achievements are:
        <ul>
          <li>Getting my Bachelor Degree in English from the University of Washington</li>
          <li>Earning a second degree in Interpreting</li>
          <li>Mastering a second language (ASL)</li>
          <li>Owning a french bulldog</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    <h4>My Interests</h4>
      <p>
        To help you get a better sense of who I am on a more personal level, here are some of my favorite things:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Candy</li>
          <li>Reading fantasy and historical fiction novels</li>
          <li>Hanging out with my husband and my dog</li>
          <li>Bar trivia</li>
        </ul>
