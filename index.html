                  My name is Katy Daviscourt and I grew up right here in <strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>. It's a beautiful place that I am happy to call home again after living for four years in California. I have been working as an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter for the last several years, and while I will be sad to leave that community, <span class="cool">I look forward to the opportunities ahead of me</span>. I hope in the future to find a way to tie my knowledge of the Deaf community into my work as a developer. Some of my past achievements are:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Getting my Bachelor Degree in <em>English</em> from the University of Washington</li>
                    <li>Earning a second degree in <em>Interpreting</em></li>
                    <li>Mastering a second language (ASL)</li>
                    <li>Owning a french bulldog</li>

                  <li>Hanging out with my husband and my dog</li>
                  <li>Bar trivia</li>
                  <li>Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens (Just kidding. Though I do enjoy watching The Sound of Music now and again.)</li>
